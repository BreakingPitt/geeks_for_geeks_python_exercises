# Exercise 2

### Maximum of two numbers in Python.

Given two numbers, write a Python code to find the Maximum of these two numbers.

#### Examples

```
num_a = 10, num_b = 20
Output: The max of 10 and 20 is 20
```

### Option 1

```python
num_a = 10
num_b = 20

# Max of two numbers...
max_numbers = max(num_a,num_b)

# Printing values
print("The max of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(num_a, num_b, max_numbers))
```

### Option 2 - User input

```
num_a = 10, num_b = 20
Output: The max of 10 and 20 is 20
```

```python
num_a = input("First number: ")
num_b = input("Second number: )"

# Max of two numbers...
max_numbers = max(num_a,num_b)

print("The sum of {0} and {1} is {2}" .format(num_a, num_b, max_numbers))
```
